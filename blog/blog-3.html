            <p>
            My co-op work term at Ericsson, from January to August 2021, has been incredibly exciting and challenging, and rewarding.
            Working in such a large organization in the <abbr title="Telecommunications">telecom</abbr> sector has been a fascinating insight into an industry which I didn’t know
            much about earlier. Of course, there are also important common needs that customers have; software needs to be performant, reliable, 
            customizable, easy to use and (increasingly) cloud native. Seeing how we continue to serve and exceed our customers’ needs has been
            interesting both from a technical and personal perspective. At certain times, this term was also quite challenging. 
            Covid-related changes can make coordination difficult, especially when working across time zones, not to mention the impact on my personal life.
            In the end, these factors made certain targets, such as my personal learning goals for the semester, difficult to hit.
            Although this isn’t ideal, I think it gives me direction for the future. I’ve also become more aware of the areas where
            I can help my team the most, and I learned to focus my knowledge on those areas. By matching these with my team’s needs, 
            I can make contributions which are helpful and appreciated. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="about-company">About My Company</h2>
            <p>
            Ericsson is a Swedish multinational company in the telecom sector, founded in 1876. Originally a telephone repair company, 
            Ericsson soon started building its own telephones and network equipment. Today, Ericsson offers a wide range of infrastructure,
            software and hardware to customers, including business support software (BSS), which my team was working to support over the course of my co-op.
            Working at Ericsson was a very interesting experience for a couple of reasons. Firstly, with offices in so many countries, it was 
            a great chance to meet and work with people from all over the world. On my team, I had some coworkers from Brazil and 
            India, and it was interesting to hear their perspectives and about their lives, and all the things we had in common, 
            and the ways in which we could help each other. It was also interesting to work in such a large organization, with a longer-term
            view and goals. We needed to make the best possible product, to help our customers not only now or in the near future, but for
            years to come.

            <h2 id="about-role">About My Role</h2>
            <p>
                As a software developer co-op working in automation, my primary tasks revolved around developing, maintaining and improving
                <dfn>continuous integration pipeline</dfn>s and the software libraries that they were built on. I think describing the <em>vision</em> behind a 
                <abbr title="continuous integration">CI</abbr> pipeline can sometimes be a little clearer than abstract definitions to someone who might not be familiar 
                with the terminology: we would like a technology where a developer can upload a particular section of code that they were working
                on to a remote repository, and this code can be automatically retrieved, tested, packaged, scanned, and prepared for future use, 
                while also giving the developer feedback based on the results of the tests. These pipelines provide value to development teams, 
                through greatly speeding up and standardizing the testing and building of software. When a developer uploads their change, they 
                can check the result of these pipelines and make sure they don’t merge any code that might cause issues. After the code is 
                merged, other pipelines can confirm that the change didn’t break anything, while also packaging and uploading a new build of 
                the software, which can be taken and used.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Going into this co-op term, I set several learning goals for myself, based both on my own personal experiences as well as the needs 
                of my team. Some of these goals were more technical in nature, and others related to interpersonal skills. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One goal revolved around managing my communication and work-life balance while working entirely online, which was a challenge 
                for me in the past. I think these themes were also emphasized throughout the company, even with an MS Office extension being 
                made available to help us monitor and manage our time at work. When I started this goal, I was a little concerned about my 
                ability to focus and work on my tasks, because I found I was frequently context switching from mass emails and messages, which
                were not necessarily high priority for my team. By making use of this extension, I allocated some time throughout my day to 
                focus on my tasks. Although my productivity improved, I found it more difficult to provide the level of support my team needed.
                This also helped me realize that the actual work I do throughout the day is not only measured through my tasks: I also help
                answer questions, support people using the technologies that I work with and contact other teams to coordinate work, and these
                are valuable contributions as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also made a couple of goals related to technologies which my team used, and which I thought would be good to learn. One of these
                goals related to improving my bash scripting abilities, and another was learning about Kubernetes. Both technologies are commonly 
                used in <abbr title="continuous integration">CI</abbr> pipelines and are not specific to Ericsson, although many of the tasks in my team involve did using them. By learning more 
                about these technologies, my goal was to be able to better support my team with more types of tasks, and to develop my general 
                knowledge as well. However, there were also challenges with this learning goal. While I learned about bash scripting both through 
                tutorials and tasks, I found that while it was helpful sometimes, it was not necessarily what my team usually needed the most from 
                me personally. This is because I was acting as a go-to person on my team for two internal technologies by that point, which were 
                written in other languages, and much of my work revolved around maintaining, improving, and helping people with our integrations 
                of these technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think out of all the areas of co-op I experienced so far, my performance on my learning goals was by far the weakest. Of course, I’m not 
                thrilled about this, although I learned a lot even from my failures in this area. I think maybe the most important lesson I can take away 
                from this is that while I can study many interesting technologies, the most important goals are often the ones that would help me provide 
                more of what my team needs from me. In the future, I will for sure start in this direction when setting goals to improve myself.
            </p>

            <h2 id="experiences">Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                One of my favorite aspects of this work term was that I could really be part of the team right from the beginning, instead of being 
                separated as an intern. Of course, I wasn’t necessarily on the same level of knowledge as my team members, and I did need to spend 
                time learning and improving. One of my first tasks involved working on a common software library, which could be used across many 
                of our pipelines. The library needed to be refactored, with the code translated from one language to another. While this was quite
                a challenge at the start considering I didn’t know either language, I learned a lot by the end and was able to successfully finish
                the task. I also learned about how I could take this asset and really support it, and over the rest of my co-op term, I would 
                always improve it and help other teams implement and use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also made many technical mistakes at the start, which were tough for me to fix at the time, though a great learning
                experience. For example, I had some technical issues when deploying my first task, and I had to work extra hard to 
                support and fix them. Of course, this was somewhat predictable when working on a section of code which was used in so many
                places. Although this was really quite stressful, I learned a lot about the underlying technologies, and developed a more 
                detail-oriented mindset which I believe will be helpful even in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also had the chance to work with another team, located in India on migrating from one version of an internal software to 
                another. This was a great learning experience when it came to working with different cultures and time zones, and on 
                supporting and managing priorities between multiple teams. Specifically, I could take my knowledge from my team and use 
                it to help and support my work on the other team, while also bringing back my experiences from the new team to support my 
                original team, and even gathering feedback which could be used to improve the transition. Of course, I had many more
                interesting experiences than I can write here, but I hope this was a good overview.
            </p>

            <h2 id="relation-acedemic-studies">Relation to Acedemic Studies</h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of this co-op term, I found several places I could apply certain concepts which I learned in my Operating Systems
                and Software Design courses. Since my role involved working with linux extensively, I found this knowledge really useful for completing
                my tasks. At the same time, I think it may have been useful for me to take a cloud computing course before starting this position, 
                because our underlying software ran in Kubernetes, and my team found it a major challenge to work on these projects due to a lack of knowledge.  
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                My work term at Ericsson was a great, interesting and challenging one. I’m especially grateful for the opportunity to work 
                with such a diverse group of smart and talented people from around the world. While at the start of my work term I didn’t 
                have a lot of knowledge about Ericsson or about the technologies I worked with, I learned through my mistakes, and through 
                my goals how to focus on my team’s needs and support them in a way which leads to the greatest positive impact. There are 
                always things which might not go as well as we would like: through this term it was my learning goals. But when I think 
                about the ways that I started to support my team, and that my contributions were really appreciated and valued, I realize 
                that in the end I still learned something perhaps even more valuable than I initially expected.
